As should be noted before using these 3 calibration datasets.
Both the Ardu cam and NoIR cam barely suffered from distortion, as such,
there is no real reason to use these calibrations.

The HQ Cam calibration is however very nessecary to implement!

It should also be noted, that the calibrations were done with the -
code in this folder, alongside the image captures in the respetive folders.

Thanks for reading, before making any stupid mistakes ;)
